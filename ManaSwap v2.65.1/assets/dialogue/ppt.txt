Banner of the 1st Phyrxian Battalion

The war banner of the 1st Battalion of
the Phyrxian military. Consisting of 200
knights distinguished in the fields of
battle. Members of the 1st Battalion were 
shock troopers in the campaign against Atarnus. 
Only one commander has ever served in the 1st
Battalion. Not a single member lives long enough 
to replace him.
Banner of the 41st Phyrxian Battalion

The war banner of the 41st Battalion of the 
Phyrxian military. Also known as the "Peasant Mob",
these 800 soldiers were the first conscripts 
to be added to the Phyrxian military since its
founding. Often ridiculed by their well-trained 
superiors, the Peasant Mob was used as fodder 
to protect the single-digit Battalions.

Banner of the 52nd Phyrxian Battalion

The war banner of the 52nd Battalion of 
the Phyrxian military, which consisted
of 1000 Tentoril slaves forced to fight
in the Final War. While the 41st 
battalion could be promoted if they
display heroism in combat, the 52nd would
never enjoy benefits greater than serving
the empire that conquered them.
