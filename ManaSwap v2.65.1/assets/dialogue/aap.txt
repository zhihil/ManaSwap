Ancient metal statuette, crude imitation

The Atarnus are known as the "Desecrators
of the Sky" by the Phyrxians. These ragged
raiders constructed their entire society
from theft of Phyrxian culture. The 
secret art of metalweaving was stolen by
the Atarnus and later traded to the 
Tentoril and the Unserjad. This statuette
embodies Atarnean-Phyrxian relations.
Scholarly journal from the City of Fragrance

Fragments of a journal by an unknown Phyrxian
scholar. From the few scraps that remain
of this text, it seems that the Anaugur,
a hero in Atarnean culture said to have 
first breached the City of Fragrance, 
was a bastard child to a previous Phyrxian 
king. The journal is stamped with a 
red blossoming flower.
Fragment of a treatise, signed not stamped

The lower portion of a legal document from the
City of Fragrance, it reads: "...will cease
to continue their campaign on Atarnean 
territory. Under the condition that the
Council of Fifty Lords is recognized as...".
A signature at the bottom reads, "Arexenus
Syrax".
