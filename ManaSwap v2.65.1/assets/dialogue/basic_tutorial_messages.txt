Welcome to ManaSwap, prospector!
Your goal is to match these gems so
they make a matching row or column.
(Click anywhere to continue.)
A matching row or column is when
3 or more gems of the same colour
line up.

Try it! Select the red gem, the one that
is highlighted.

(Left-click on the red gem)
Now select the blue gem, highlighted in
red.

See how the gems disappeared prospector?
They were collected to increase your
Mana Points or your score.
(Click anywhere to continue.)
Your Mana Points here have increased by
150, because you matched 3 gems. The
longer your matching row or column...
(Click anywhere to continue.)
...the more points you'll earn. If you
match 4 gems, you'll get 300 points. If
you match 5 gems, you'll get 500, etc.
(Click anywhere to continue).
Notice that your number of moves was 1,
but went down to 0. When this number hits
0, it's game over!
(Click anywhere to continue.)
Get as many points as you can before
running out of moves. Your score is
recorded in the "highscores" menu.
(Click anywhere to continue.)
You can also click exit here if you want 
to end the game early.

(Click anywhere to continue.)
Good luck, prospector!
