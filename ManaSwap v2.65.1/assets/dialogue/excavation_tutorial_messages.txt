Still here? Great! Excavation mode is 
all about collecting runes, which are 
written over the gems above.
(Click anywhere to continue) 
This rune is called "atarn" or just "a" 
for short.

(Click anywhere to continue) 
This rune is called "phyxus" or "p".


(Click anywhere to continue) 
This rune is called "tentorii" or just 
"t"

(Click anywhere to continue) 
This rune is called "unser" or simply 
"u"! 

(Click anywhere to continue) 
Try matching these gems here and see 
what happens. Select the red gem.


Now select the blue gem!



See how the runes disappeared with the
matching column? They were collected and 
stored in your "treasures" in the main menu
(Click anywhere to continue) 
"Treasures"are wonderful artifacts that will 
shed light on the Final War.

Soon Olombre's history will be unlocked
for the first time in thousands of years!

Runes that you collect are  permanently 
removed from the board! So think carefully 
about what combination of runes you want.
(Click anywhere to continue) 
You just collected an "atarn" rune, 
a "tentorii" rune, and a "phyxus" rune.

Have a look in the "treasures" menu 
after this tutorial! It will be listed as...
(Click anywhere to continue) 
..."apt", which stands for "atarn",
"phyxus", and "tentorii". This
treasures was unlocked with 3 runes.
(Click anywhere to continue) 
There are treasures that are unlocked
with 4 or 5 runes. These are more rare.
Then there are treasures with 6 runes...
(Click anywhere to continue) 
...enough of that. You're still
collecting Mana Points in this mode and 
they can be used to unlock treasures!
(Click to anywhere to continue) 
You need a lot of Mana Points to transmute
Treasures however! So collecting runes is
the easiest way to get what you want.
(Click to anywhere to continue) 
That's all there is to it. You have
an unlimited amount of moves. Collect
as many treasures as you can!

Good luck prospector!
