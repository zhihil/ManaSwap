War banner of a Unserand Lord

The Devouring God slumbers in the Devouring
sea. No mortal tames him, save for Unser the
Shipwright. A master of shipbuilding, Unser
uplifted his people and brought prosperity.

Unser lead an expedition through the White 
Strait on the Medusela, never to be seen again.

Compass apparatus, built with iron

The Unserjad stole from the masters of metal,
and built this contraption. A curious device 
that always points in one direction. Used
for navigation in the tumultous oceans. The
Unserjad relied on the compass.

It is said that near the lands of Poloss,
the power of the compass fails. 
Schematics of a oceanvesssel

A series of schematics written on Ayakka-hide,
depicting a strange, mostly empty vessel. The
Unser were perhaps the only to master the
creation of ships. Complex mechanisms allowed
the ship to use the Ocean's violent tides
to its advantage. The Unserjad settled on the
Outer Rim, far from Horam. There, storms were
few and the Unserjad prospered.
