Icon of a man, trapped in a coffin

A sigil depicting a man trapped within a
coffin. His hands wrap his throat, as 
though desparately seeking air. This
figure appears to be buried alive.

This sigil is crafted from the finest gold 
and decorated with obsidian. There was
careful, perhaps obsessive care put in it. 
Large Gilded Sarcophagus

An ornmental sarcophagus found in a 
cathedral in a subterranean city. An image
of a man strangling himself has been
carved onto the cover. While the
hinges and lock on the lid shows wear,
indicating that the coffin has been used
before, there is no body within. Could
someone have looted it before?
Indecipherable Ritual Book

A holy text, written in some unknown script.
The language is not Atarnean, yet multiple
copies were found in ruined bookstores
and archives. Illustrations depict
smiling figures resting within golden
coffins. Robed figures stand over the smiling
men, holding chains on their right hand
and a candle on their left.
