The Great Plague

A wave of miasma that encroached the
land of Horam and the Outer Rim. It was
said to be the harbinger of the end,
when the Ocean would finally swallow the
Earth whole. Famine followed the plague
closely. And what followed famine, was
war.

The Final War

Known at the time as the "War to end all
Wars". Who struck the first blow is 
uncertain, but it was likely the Phyrxian,
who became unaccustomed to a life without
their ceaseless luxuries. The Final War
began with the enslavement of the Tentoril,
to acquire the Ayakka herds. But it was not
enough. 
The End

The Final War was a century-long campaign.
First, the Tentoril were extinguished. Then,
the Phyrxians were outlasted. The Atarneans
slowly withered away. And the Unserjad sailed 
to Poloss, following the example of Unser the 
First, never to be seen again. These are the 
memories they stored in the runestones. 
Will we become like them?
