Rusted Metal Statuette, 532

Few civilizations make stone tools, fewer
still master the use of metal. There was
once a floating city, built of metal, by
the Phyrxians. They called it Ghyraxus.

Though they were denounced as hedonists,
theirs was the greatest civilization
Olombre had ever seen.
Vintage Phyrxian, 560

A shattered wine bottle that once held Phyrxian
vintage. Prized by artifact collectors. The
city of Ghyraxus was known as the Castle of
Fragrance, for it was rife with the scent of 
the gourmet and the refined. Whilst Olombre
wasted away in the rain and the mud, the
Phyrxians indulged in pleasure. Prosperity
spread like a plague. 
Undertakers' reports, 579

A scroll encased in a bronze ornamental case.
The contents are an Undetaker's records. It
was said that a green haze loomed over 
Ghyraxus, violating its air with disease. 
Those afflicted were marked with black spots.
Though some survived, the Fragrances of 
Ghyraxus were quenched, replaced by the hideous
filth of the plague.
