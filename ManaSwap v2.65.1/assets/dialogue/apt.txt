Fragment of a map of Olombre, part 1

An Ayakka-hide sheet vaguely resembling a map. 
Ceaseless rain smothers Olombre, eroding the
earth, changing the lands. 

Maps become obsolete within months of their 
making. Lands that once stood above the clouds 
eventually become lost in the Devouring Ocean.

Olombre cradles two lands: Horam and Poloss. 
Horam is the largest. There lies a great
volcano, guarded by the Lone Jungle. Poloss
lies south. Little is known about it, only
one sailor is said to have survived the 
crossing of the White Strait into Poloss.

In antiquity, there were four civilizations,
that had expanded far enough to map the 
world: The first to rise was Tentoril, the
herders of Ayakka. Then came those who
mastered metal, the Phyrxyn. With no
land left for them, third came the Unserjad
who conquered the Ocean. Last were the 
Atarnus, the stormriders, easily forgotten, 
easily underestimated.
