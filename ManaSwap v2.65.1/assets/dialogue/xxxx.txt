Dim Gem with lingering runic energy

A darkened mana gem, unlike the circular
ones uncovered in the Excavation. This gem
takes the form of a double-helix and what
remains of its power will soon disappear.
This relic seems older than the Final War.
Upon touching the gem, images of an unknown
city floods the mind. Who could have made this?
Tentoril? Atarnus? Phyrxian? Unserjad? None. 
Canister of runic energy

A cylindrical canister containing a shattered
double-helix. The device responds violently 
when a mana gem replaces the double helix. 
When coupled to an electronic, the sheer
amount of energy overwhelms the circuitry.

This device dates to the Final War, however,
the double helix, like the previous, is older.
Overflowing double helix

A complete double-helix, albeit with small
cracks on its surface. Upon touching the
device, memories of an unknown land flood
the mind, though the scenery is familiar.
Ceaseless rain and a ravenous ocean. 
A similar effect is produced by the mana gems,
although it is lesser and requires multiple 
runes in conjunction to function properly.
