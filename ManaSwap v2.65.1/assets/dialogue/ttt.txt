Scrap of Ayakka-hide, tanned and cured

A scrap of Ayakka-hide, taken from a mighty
Ayakka that roamed the Great Murk Plains. 
These monstrous creatures stood over 30
metres tall, and despite their immense size,
were able to gracefully stride over mud
without sinking. Their hydrophobic skin made
them useful for creating books, which were
written in Ayakka body oils. 
Ocarina, fashioned from Ayakka tusk

An ocarina used to tame Ayakka. Its craftsmanship 
is of Tentorii origin. The Great Plains Herders, 
the Tentoril, were famed for their symbiotic 
relationship with the Ayakka. By sheltering in the 
hollow insides of the Ayakka, the Tentoril were able 
to establish sophisticated societies without worry of
Olombre's storms. The Herders have great respect 
for the Ayakka, taking only necessities.
Desecrated Ayakka tusk, overflowing with rot

A fossilized Ayakka tusk. Brown markings
indicate the work of the Great Plague, which
threw the civilizations of Olombre into
disarray. The Tentoril were the first to
succumb to the Plague and the first to be
eradicated in the Final War. 
Analysis shows that the Great Plague most 
likely originated from the Ayakka.
